# FOS_Framework
 
A Framework I personally created for my own missions. Some people seem to like it a lot, so I've put it on Github in an easy way to access.
I can not stress enough that this is WIP. So, if you use this framework, just be aware that it isn't 100% perfect yet. I try to test any changes at least once in MP before moving it to Master branch.

Regardless, if there any specific functions in this framework that you would like, take it.

As a mission maker, most of external files you will have to edit will be settings.hpp and briefing.sqf
